 # Autoplay for funky friday, rewrite of the old code wally-rbx made back in 2022-2023
an open sourced autoplayer for https://www.roblox.com/games/6447798030, made by me, taken inspiration from wally-rbx (when i say taken inspiration i mean i took the arrow accuracy math from the original code)

# Discord/contacting me
made a small discord server for this script, but my discord is relevant500.

Any bugs can be sent there, if there is any, send WHAT song you were playing, if you played that song before, what executor you used and if toggling the autoplayer did anything to help.
